# Documentation Organization Summary

## Changes Made

I've reorganized the RTFS project documentation to improve structure and discoverability:

### New Directory Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md                           # Documentation overview and navigation
├── NEXT_STEPS_UPDATED.md              # Development roadmap (moved from root)
├── implementation/                     # Technical implementation documentation
│   ├── README.md                      # Implementation docs overview
│   └── RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md  # Comprehensive runtime system documentation
└── [future implementation docs]       # Space for additional implementation guides
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Centralized Documentation**: Created `docs/` directory as the main hub for all non-specification documentation
2. **Implementation Focus**: Created `docs/implementation/` specifically for technical implementation details
3. **Clear Navigation**: Added README files with proper cross-references and organization guidelines
4. **Updated Main README**: Enhanced project README with comprehensive documentation links

### File Movements

- `RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/implementation/RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `NEXT_STEPS_UPDATED.md` → `docs/NEXT_STEPS_UPDATED.md`

### Documentation Types by Location

#### `/docs/implementation/` - Technical Implementation
- Runtime system architecture and features
- Component implementation summaries
- Performance analysis and optimization guides
- Testing documentation and validation approaches

#### `/docs/specs/` - Language Specifications (unchanged)
- Core language specifications and grammar
- Type system and semantics documentation
- Standard library specifications
- Security and resource management models

#### Root Level - Project Overview
- Main project README with getting started information
- License and contribution guidelines
- High-level project status and roadmap

### Benefits

- **Better Organization**: Related documents are grouped logically
- **Easier Navigation**: Clear directory structure with helpful README files
- **Scalability**: Room for future documentation without cluttering the root
- **Developer-Friendly**: Implementation details are separate from user-facing specs
- **Maintenance**: Clear ownership and update guidelines for each documentation type

### Future Additions

The new structure accommodates future documentation such as:
- `docs/implementation/PARSER_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/implementation/STDLIB_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md`
- `docs/implementation/TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/user-guides/` for user-facing documentation
- `docs/tutorials/` for learning materials

This organization provides a solid foundation for the project's growing documentation needs while maintaining clarity and accessibility.
