# RTFS Implementation Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation about the implementation of various RTFS components.

## Contents

### Runtime System
- **[RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](./RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Comprehensive overview of the RTFS runtime system implementation, including architecture, features, and testing results.

## Purpose

This directory serves as a repository for:

- **Implementation Summaries**: Detailed documentation of completed features and components
- **Architecture Decisions**: Rationale behind key design choices
- **Performance Analysis**: Benchmarks, optimizations, and performance characteristics
- **Testing Documentation**: Test coverage, validation approaches, and results
- **Integration Guides**: How different components work together

## Organization

Files in this directory should follow the naming convention:
- `{COMPONENT}_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - For comprehensive component overviews
- `{FEATURE}_ARCHITECTURE.md` - For architectural deep-dives
- `{SUBSYSTEM}_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md` - For performance-related documentation
- `{MODULE}_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - For testing documentation

## Target Audience

This documentation is intended for:
- RTFS developers and contributors
- System integrators working with RTFS
- Researchers studying the RTFS implementation
- Anyone seeking deep technical understanding of RTFS internals

## Maintenance

These documents should be updated as the implementation evolves to maintain accuracy and completeness.
