# Testing Strategy for RTFS Runtime

This document outlines the testing strategy for the RTFS (Reasoning Task Flow Specification) runtime system.

## 1. Introduction

Briefly describe the importance of testing for the RTFS runtime.

## 2. Types of Tests

### 2.1. Unit Tests

-   **Scope:** Individual components, modules, functions.
-   **Goals:** Verify correctness of isolated units of code.
-   **Tools/Frameworks:** (Specify if any, e.g., built-in testing, specific libraries)
-   **Examples:**
    -   Testing parsing of individual IR nodes.
    -   Testing evaluation of specific operations.
    -   Testing validation logic for task definitions.

### 2.2. Integration Tests

-   **Scope:** Interactions between different components or modules of the runtime.
-   **Goals:** Ensure that integrated parts work together as expected.
-   **Examples:**
    -   Testing the flow from parsing an RTFS script to executing a simple task.
    -   Testing interaction between the execution engine and the state management module.
    -   Testing error handling across component boundaries.

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

-   **Scope:** Testing the entire RTFS runtime system from an end-user perspective.
-   **Goals:** Validate complete task flows and overall system behavior.
-   **Methodology:**
    -   Define representative RTFS scripts for common use cases.
    -   Execute these scripts using the runtime.
    -   Verify outputs, side effects, and final state.
-   **Examples:**
    -   Executing a complex RTFS script involving multiple tasks, conditional logic, and data manipulation.
    -   Testing the runtime's ability to handle concurrent task execution (if applicable).
    -   Verifying correct error reporting for invalid scripts or runtime errors.

## 3. Test Coverage

-   Discuss goals for test coverage (e.g., line coverage, branch coverage).
-   How will test coverage be measured and tracked?

## 4. Continuous Integration (CI)

-   How will tests be integrated into the development workflow?
-   Will there be automated test runs on commits/pull requests?

## 5. Test Data Management

-   How will test data be created and managed?
-   Strategies for generating realistic and diverse test inputs.

## 6. Future Considerations

-   Performance testing.
-   Security testing.
-   Usability testing (if applicable to any tooling around the runtime).
