# RTFS Code Generation and Interpretation (Placeholder)

This document will outline the strategies for code generation (transpilation) to various target languages/platforms and the design for a direct RTFS IR interpreter.

## 1. Introduction

- Goals: Portability, performance, ease of integration.
- Overview of potential targets and interpretation strategy.

## 2. Direct IR Interpretation

- Design of the RTFS runtime environment.
- How each IR node type is executed.
- Memory management.
- Error handling at runtime.
- Standard library implementation within the interpreter.
- Interfacing with external tools.

## 3. Code Generation (Transpilation)

### 3.1. General Principles

- Mapping RTFS types to target language types.
- Handling RTFS semantics (e.g., immutability, concurrency) in target languages.
- Source mapping for debugging.

### 3.2. Target: Clojure

- Rationale.
- Mapping IR nodes to Clojure forms.
- Interoperability.

### 3.3. Target: Rust

- Rationale.
- Mapping IR nodes to Rust constructs.
- Memory safety and ownership considerations.
- FFI for tool calls.

### 3.4. Target: WebAssembly (Wasm)

- Rationale.
- Mapping IR to Wasm instructions or a higher-level language that compiles to Wasm.
- Interfacing with JavaScript environment.

### 3.5. Target: Python (Bytecode or Source)

- Rationale.
- Mapping IR to Python constructs.
- Integration with Python ecosystem.

## 4. Runtime Services

- Services required by generated code or the interpreter (e.g., for tool dispatch, resource management).

## 5. Future Targets
