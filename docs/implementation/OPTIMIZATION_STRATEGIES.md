# RTFS Optimization Strategies (Placeholder)

This document will detail the various optimization techniques that can be applied to the RTFS Intermediate Representation (IR).

## 1. Introduction

- Goals of optimization (performance, resource usage, etc.)
- Phases of optimization (e.g., machine-independent, machine-dependent if applicable)

## 2. IR-Level Optimizations

- Constant Folding
- Dead Code Elimination
- Inlining
- Loop Optimizations (if applicable to RTFS constructs)
- Strength Reduction
- Common Subexpression Elimination
- Others relevant to RTFS semantics

## 3. Data Structure Optimizations

- Optimizing map/vector operations
- Type-specific optimizations

## 4. Tool Call Optimizations

- Memoization of tool calls (where appropriate)
- Batching of tool calls

## 5. Parallelism Optimizations

- Optimizing `:ir/parallel` blocks

## 6. Future Considerations
